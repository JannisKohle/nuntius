A very great twitter clone written in Node; Express; Mongo; Vue or vanilla JS

## How it works:

It works pretty much just like twitter:
- You can create an account
- You can write small posts (or tweets)
- You can include pictures in posts
- You can like other posts and reply to them
- Of course, you can also reply to other replies
- You can follow other people

## The rest api:

### Endpoints:

- ```/search?s={keyword}```
- ```/recommendations```
- ```/trending```
- ```/following```
- ```/posts```
- ```/posts/:postId```
- ```/accounts```
- ```/accounts/:username```
- ```/settings```
